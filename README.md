## 🌟 Overview

This project utilizes **Deep Learning (PyTorch)** to classify breast cancer cases as **benign or malignant**, supporting early medical intervention. 🏥🎗️

### 🛠️ Features

✅ **PyTorch Deep Learning Model** for cancer classification.\
✅ **Trained on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** for reliable predictions.\
✅ **Pretrained Model (`Breast_Cancer_Prediction_PyTorch.sav`)** for immediate usage.\
✅ **Interactive Jupyter Notebook (`Breast_Cancer_Prediction_DL.ipynb`)** to visualize and refine the model.\

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** (available in sklearn & Kaggle).\
- Features include **cell size, shape, texture, and more** for classification.\
- **Target Classes:** 0 → Benign, 1 → Malignant.
